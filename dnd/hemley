The Ballad of Hemley Quickfingers,
Saint of Thieves

==================================

Come ye all
Who live by the pick,
Listen to the tale
Of young Halfling Quick.

For all of the richmen
Who hoarded their gold
Came the young Hemley,
The burgler of bold!

[chorus]
When tough was a task
That no other thief could,
Hemley Quickfingers
Was the one who would.
Just over three feet
This great young saint stood,
But always for only
That which was good!
[/chorus]

Wherever the hoarder
A deadly trap did lay,
Quick with his Fingers
Great Hemley would play!

[chorus]

Upon a great dragon
Once rode a Red Wizard
But with a mere treebranch
He defeated the lizard!

[chorus]
